Welcome to PathFinder's documentation!
======================================
PathFinder is a aftermarket heads up display for cars that shows navigational instructions as well
as valuable metrics from the vehicle. This documentation goes over the code that drives the PathFinder. 
We used a Raspberry Pi 3B+, GPS NEO-6M, and UCTRONICS I2C OLED display during development.
